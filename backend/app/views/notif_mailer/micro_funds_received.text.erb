We detected a new transaction on your GuessGoals wallet. Unfortunately, we have to decline this transaction due to amount being less than the minimum acceptable amount (<%= @minimum_acceptable_amount %> BTC). Details are attached below for your reference.

Amount              | <%= @amount %> BTC  
Transaction Id      | <%= @txid %>        
Received on Address | <%= @address %>     
Received at         | <%= @performed_at %>

You can send the funds back to yourself once we receive six block confirmations for this transaction.


Thank You,
GuessGoals Support
